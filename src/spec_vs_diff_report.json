  "summary": "Diff adds new UI components for per-category works sections and a hover/focus thumbnail overlay. However, due to truncation of PortfolioPage.tsx, the actual regrouping/rendering logic in the Works tab (and confirmation that Add Work remains available after regrouping) cannot be fully verified from the provided evidence.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-12",
      "requirement": "In the authenticated dashboard (Portfolio → Management → Works), works are displayed grouped by category, with each category rendered as its own visible section containing only that category’s works.",
      "reason": "A GroupedWorksSection component is added and imported into PortfolioPage.tsx, but the diff snippet is truncated before showing the Works tab rendering that iterates categories and passes category-matched works into each section. The only visible filtering shown is a single selectedCategoryId filter, which does not by itself prove per-category section grouping.",

    {
      "id": "REQ-12",
      "requirement": "Existing actions (Add Work, Edit, Delete) remain available and functional for works after the regrouping.",
      "reason": "Edit/Delete buttons are clearly present in GroupedWorksSection, but the diff does not show (due to truncation) that the Works tab still renders the Add Work action in the regrouped layout.",
